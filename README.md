## 🚨 The Problem

Single-model AI systems:
- Hallucinate confidently

- Debate a problem from multiple perspectives
- Critique each other anonymously
- Preserve minority opinions
- Synthesize a final, reasoned answer

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- Multi-agent debate (3–7 LLMs)
- Structured peer review
- Bias-aware reasoning
- Full explainability & audit trail
- Multilingual Indian language support
- Modular & scalable architecture

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. User submits a query  
2. Independent AI agents debate  
3. Peer review highlights flaws & bias  
4. Synthesis agent produces final output  
5. Safety & bias checks run  
6. Full reasoning is logged and delivered
